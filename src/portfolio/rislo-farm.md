### Technologies Leveraged

To accomplish the project's objectives, I utilized the following cutting-edge technologies:

- MongoDB for efficient and scalable database management.
- GraphQL for flexible and optimized data querying.
- Daisy UI and Tailwind CSS for crafting a visually appealing and responsive user interface.
- Flask (Python) for building a robust backend infrastructure.
- Svelte (sveltekit) to develop high-performance frontend components.
